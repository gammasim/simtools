description: |-
  Parameter controlling the orientation of the pixels, setting it to be
  aligned with the optical axis or the focal surface normal.
  A value of 0 indicates that the pixel is oriented such that the surface
  is aligned with the focal surface (pixel axis parallel to focal surface
  normal).
  A value of 1 indicates, that pixels are only shifted parallel to the
  optical axis. Pixel surfaces remain perpendicular to the optical axis.
  A value of 2 places all pixels belonging to the same module
  (as configured in the ``Pixels'' lines in the par:camera-config-file)
  on a common plane, with its orientation along the normal to the focal
  surface in the module center (c.o.g. of pixels) and with zero mean
  displacements of pixels along the $z$ axis.
  A value of 3 (=2+1) has all pixels in a common plane per module and
  all of the modules (and thus all of the pixels) looking parallel to
  the optical axis. The 'height' (in z) of the module is again the
  average of where individually placed pixels would be (zero mean
  displacement in module).
  An extension to the camera definition file even allows for pixels to be
  configured individually and not exactly following the focal surface
  (in both height and orientation).
