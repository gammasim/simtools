description: |-
  Emulate FADC pedestal compensation (as e.g., done in camera firmware using FPGAs)
  to homogenize significant pixel-to-pixel variations of raw pedestals values
  (for low-gain channel for dual-gain readout).
  The resulting values are still unsigned integers and no rescaling takes place
  (pure integer pedestal offset). No compensation takes place for the default value
  of "-1".  Values greater or equal to zero indicate the compensated pedestal value,
  rounded to the nearest integer. For DC-coupled sensors, the compensation includes
  any NSB pedestal shift. For cameras with multiple interlaced FADCs per channel and,
  therefore, multiple pedestal values, the same integer compensation gets applied to
  all pedestals of a channel. While the normal pedestal reported in the data includes
  the compensation, the individual compensations applied for each pixel are reported
  separately. If individual FADC values would fall below zero through this compensation,
  they are clipped at zero.
