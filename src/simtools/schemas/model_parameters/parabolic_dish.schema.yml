description: |-
  Parabolic dish.
  Mirror tiles still have spherical shape (similar to the Davies-Cotton
  optics), but their focal lengths are adapted to the distance from the
  focus (since the geometric mean of minimum and maximum radius of
  curvature of the paraboloid is very close to that distance).
short_description: Parabolic dish shape is used.
