description: |-
  Laser (or LED or other pulsed light source) events at start of run, before the first shower event.\
  The assumed light source would typically be in the center of the dish and is assumed to illuminate all pixels uniformly.\
  The camera lid is assumed to be open, i.e. events will also be subject to NSB.\
  A value of zero means that the data will not contain any such events.
short_description: |-
  Relative variation of laser shots from shot to shot.
