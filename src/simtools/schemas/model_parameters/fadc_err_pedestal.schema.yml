name: fadc_err_pedestal
developer_note: |-
  TODO - check if this is relevant as this affects only the reported
  pedestals (which are not used in the reconstruction).
description: |-
  Assumed error (Gaussian r.m.s.) in initial calibration of pedestal
  (for high-gain channel for dual-gain readout).
  The calibration is based on a limited number of events and therefore the
  reported pedestal value is not exactly what is used in the simulation.
  The parameter affects only the reported pedestal
  (reported as monitoring data), not the true pedestals used in the
  simulation.
