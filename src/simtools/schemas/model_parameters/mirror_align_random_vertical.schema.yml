name: mirror_align_random_vertical
description: |-
  Fluctuations of the mirror alignment angle with respect to nominal
  alignment in the vertical component (in altitude or $x$ direction in
  dish coordinates). The three terms are added up as independent
  (i.e., by squares; therefore he square of the vertical mirror
  alignment error is $\sigma^2 = \sigma_0^2 + \sigma_c^2 + \sigma_s^2$).
  The values here are usually derived from fits to the measured point
  spread functions, with the single mirror point-spread function adapted
  beforehand. Note that, since this affects the angles of the mirrors,
  the impact on the combined spot size is twice as large.
short_description: |-
  Gaussian r.m.s. spread of random fluctuations of the mirror alignment
  angle with respect to nominal alignment in the vertical component.
