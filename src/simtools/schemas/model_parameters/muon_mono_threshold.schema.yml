description: |-
  If the array trigger requires triggers from more than one telescope, the events best
  suitable for muon-ring calibration purposes, initiated by isolated muons, would be
  severely suppressed. Events with triggers in an extended area of the camera are a
  good indicator of muon rings and can be made to pass by stereo event selection.
  The first parameter is a threshold on the number of trigger groups fired, the second
  a threshold on the number of - yet to be determined - larger regions in which any
  trigger groups fired.
