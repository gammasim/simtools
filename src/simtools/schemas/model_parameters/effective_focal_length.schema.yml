name: effective_focal_length
developer_note: |-
  Not a simulation model parameter but used for the analysis only.
  Should be discussed further if this is the right place.
description: |-
  Due to asymmetric image aberrations, in particular for single-reflector
  telescope, segmented or not, the inverse image 'plate scale' or, more
  precisely, the ratio of off-center distance in the focal plane
  (projection for curved focal surface) to the tangent of the off-axis
  angle, does not match the nominal focal plane very well. This effective
  value here should be better suitable for shower reconstruction than the
  nominal focal length and is supposed to be based on ray-tracing
  simulations of point sources, at distances typical of showers and
  imaged onto the actual focal surface at the level of the pixel entrances.
  Non-zero values will be reported as-is in the output data and
  may be used for the built-in reconstruction in sim_telarray. If no value is given,
  sim_telarray may estimate a value, based on optics type and f/D ratio, for its
  internal purpose but will not report such an estimate in the output data.
  Due to subtle effects of image cleaning (and thus image intensity) on
  cutting off parts of the asymmetric point-spread function, analysis
  programs should use this value or, if not available, an estimate of it
  only as a starting point and evaluate the actual analysis specific
  and perhaps image intensity and NSB dependent real effective focal length
  by itself.
