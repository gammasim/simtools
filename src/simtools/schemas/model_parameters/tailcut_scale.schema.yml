description: |-
  The special scheme for selecting pixels belonging to a shower image as implemented in sim_telarray
  (as opposed to the traditional two-level tailcut scheme) has multiple thresholds
  for the various levels of confidence that a pixel actually belongs to the shower image.
  Instead of making them individually configurable, a common scale factor can be applied to all of them.
