name: camera_filter
description: |-
  Wavelength dependence of the camera filter transmission, independent
  of the pixel type.  The transmission may be given for the average or
  various incidence angles.  In the latter case, the transmission is
  applied for each photon as a function of both its wavelength and its
  incidence angle.  The efficiency factors will be applied on top of the
  global par:camera-transmission factor, and on top of any pixel-type
  dependent efficiency (both angular and by wavelength), according to
  the what is listed in par:camera_config_pixel_type.
short_description: |-
  Wavelength dependence of the camera transmission, possibly as a function
  of incidence angle.
