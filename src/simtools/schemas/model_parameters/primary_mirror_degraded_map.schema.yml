name: primary_mirror_degraded_map
description: |-
  Position-dependent map of degradation factors for the (primary) mirror.
  This degradation gets applied on top of mirror_degraded_reflection.
  Note that the impact of it on the night-sky background is not automatically
  accounted for and must be evaluated separately and included in the
  configured NSB pixel p.e. rates. It is recommended to use a map with an
  average efficiency of 1.0 and use mirror_degraded_reflection
  for the overall degradation.  Tables with equidistant spacing in both x and
  y are highly recommended because the interpolation is faster.
