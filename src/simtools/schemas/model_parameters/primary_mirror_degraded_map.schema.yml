name: primary_mirror_degraded_map
description: |-
  Position-dependent map of degradation factors for the primary mirror.
  This degradation gets applied on top of mirror_degraded_reflection.
  Note that the impact of it on the nightsky background is not automatically
  accounted for and must be evaluated separately and included in the
  configured NSB pixel p.e. rates. It is recommended to use a map with an
  average efficiency of 1.0 and use mirror_degraded_reflection
  for the overall degradation.  Tables with equidistant spacing in both x and
  y are highly recommended because the interpolation is faster.
