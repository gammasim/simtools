name: stars
description: |-
  A file with a list of stars shining, containing one row per star with azimuth,
  altitude (both in degrees) and weighting factor for the number of photons. An
  optional fourth value is the distance of the light source (in kilometers) or 0
  (standing for infinity). In addition to ray-tracing evaluation, the stars also contribute
  to the nighsky background rate in the affected pixels.
