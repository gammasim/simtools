name: mirror_degraded_reflection
description: |-
  Mirror degradation factor (wavelength independent).
  Applied to the mirror reflectivity of the primary mirror
  (note also the primary, secondary, and camera efficiency
  degradation factors).
  What matters typically is the overall product of the efficiencies.
  Breaking it down into mirror(s) and/or camera degradation
  only matters where BYPASS_OPTICS becomes involved. Then this parameter
  is actually interpreted as being for reflection on the primary mirror
  (would not be relevant for a flat-fielding light source directly illuminating
  the camera or illuminating it via reflection on the secondary mirror).
  The nightsky background in each pixel is also scaled by the same factor
  (even if the actual simulation bypasses optical ray-tracing).
  For wavelength-dependent degradation, the tables for reflectivity,
  window transmission, or light-cone efficiency need to be adapted.
