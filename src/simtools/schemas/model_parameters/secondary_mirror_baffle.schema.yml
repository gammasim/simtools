name: secondary_mirror_baffle
description: |-
  Defines a baffle around the secondary mirror to keep NSB light from
  falling directly onto the camera. Shadowing by the baffle is applied
  both to incoming photons and to photons reflected from the primary
  to the secondary mirror. Absence of a baffle is indicated by $r_1=0$.

  Defines a baffle around the secondary mirror to keep NSB light from
  falling directly onto the camera.
data:
  - name: baffle_z1
    description: |-
      Beginning of the baffle along the optical axis, counted from the
      primary center, which means a z value of par:secondary_ref_radius
      times the first par:secondary_mirror_parameters value is at the
      height of the center of the secondary.
    type: double
    unit: cm
    required: true
    condition: mirror_class==2
    default: 0.
  - name: baffle_z2
    description: |-
      End of the baffle along the optical axis, counted from the
      primary center, which means a z value of par:secondary_ref_radius
      times the first par:secondary_mirror_parameters value is at the
      height of the center of the secondary.
    type: double
    unit: cm
    required: true
    condition: mirror_class==2
    default: 0.
  - name: radius_r1
    description: Radius of open cylinder shape or cone shape at baffle_z1.
    type: double
    unit: cm
    required: true
    condition: mirror_class==2
    default: 0.
  - name: thickness_d1
    description: |-
      Wall thickness of the baffle. The radius radius_r1 and radius_r2
      are the inner radii in case of finite wall thickness.
    type: double
    unit: cm
    required: false
    condition: mirror_class==2
    default: 0.
  - name: radius_r2
    description: Radius of open cylinder shape or cone shape at baffle_z2.
    type: double
    unit: cm
    required: false
    condition: mirror_class==2
    default: 0.
