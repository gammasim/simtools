For installation of simtools and its components, see the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section.
All software including CORSIKA, sim_telarray, and simtools is provided as pre-build images, see the [simtools container](simtools_containers.md) section.
A list of all simtools applications can be found in the [Applications](applications.md) section.

The main use cases of simtools are:

- [Generate simulated events](productions.md): Configure and run productions to generate large-scale sets of simulated event data.
- [Manage simulation models and their parameters](manage_simulation_models.md): Derive, validate, and manage simulation models and their parameters.
- [Simulate calibration data](simulate_calibration_data): Simulate calibration data, including artificial light sources and pedestal events.
