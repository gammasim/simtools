# Build and deploy simtools

## Build

Users and developers typically do not need to build simtools and its components from source. Instead, pre-built images
from the [simtools package registry](https://github.com/orgs/gammasim/packages?repo_name=simtools) should be used.

- [Build images from source](build.md) for simtools, CORSIKA, and sim_telarray.

## Release management

- [Release a new version](releases.md) of simtools. Includes deployment to PyPi and conda, and creation of a Zenodo DOI.
