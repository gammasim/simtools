Adds support for simulating arbitrary telescope layouts with CORSIKA (including “probe” telescopes for lateral density comparisons), and refactors overwrite-parameter handling to be read/validated once and reused across models. Expand functionality to generated regular arrays of telescopes with different shapes.
