CORSIKA interactions tables are not part of the CORSIKA7 container anymore and also not added to the simtools-dev container.
CORSIKA tables are now available from the new [CTAO gitlab repository corsika7-interaction-tables](https://gitlab.cta-observatory.org/cta-computing/dpps/simpipe/simulation_software/corsika7-interaction-tables). This includes QGSJet-II, QGSJet-III, EPOS, EGS4, etc tables.

The install and use the interaction tables for both production and development:

- clone that repository into a separate directory from simtools (recommend the example such that it is reachable from inside the simtools-dev container by `/workdir/external/simpipe/simulation_software/corsika7-interaction-tables/interaction-tables/`
- Add a new env variable called `SIMTOOLS_CORSIKA_INTERACTION_TABLE_PATH` pointing to that path (see example in `.env_table`)

Integration tests are cloning this repository and making the interaction tables available during testing.
