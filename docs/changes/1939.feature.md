Improved functionality to plot Cherenkov photon distributions read from CORSIKA IACT files:

- allow to compare distributions from different files
- additional 1D and 2D distributions with improved plotting
- several bug fixes in relation of weighting and density calculation

This includes a complete refactoring of the class with focus on plotting.
