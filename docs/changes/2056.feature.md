Add functionality to simulate flasher events (full ray tracing) for several telescopes.
For full simulations, there are now several options to select the telescopes to simulate:
- simulate a single telescope: `--telescopes MSTN-04`
- simulate several telescopes `--telescopes MSTN-04 MSTN-04`
- simulate all telescopes in an array `--layout_name alpha`
Recommended to use `light_source_type: flat_fielding`, which reads for a given telescopes the
defined flasher name from the model parameter database.

Similar functionality for direction injection flasher simulations: the main difference is that
in direct mode a single sim_telarray is written, while for full simulation there is one
sim_telarray per telescope.
