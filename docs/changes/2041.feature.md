Improve `simtools-plot-simtel-events` and add functionality to plot a number
of events for a given telescope (independent of event index). Plots are sorted
by plot type for easier comparison.
Minor optimization to plotting: i) solve issue with matplotlib warnings
ii) read calibration telescope data which is not from first telescope iii) reduce aspect
