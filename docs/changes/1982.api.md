Changes to the setting of seeds for sim_telarray:

- `sim_telarray_random_instrument_instances` and `sim_telarray_instrument_seed` to generate a random seed file for the given number of configurations.
- use `sim_telarray_seed` together with `sim_telarray_instrument_seed` to set both instrument (configuration) and simulation seeds. These parameters completely fix the seeds and should only be used for testing purposes.
