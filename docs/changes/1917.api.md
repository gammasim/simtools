Changes in the environment variables set in the `.env` file.

Added explicit setting of the simulation software branches:

- CORSIKA: e.g., `SIMTOOLS_CORSIKA_PATH=/workdir/simulation_software/corsika7`
- sim_telarray: e.g., `SIMTOOLS_SIMTEL_PATH=/workdir/simulation_software/sim_telarray`

Added explicit setting of the interaction models:

- high-energy interaction model: e.g., `SIMTOOLS_CORSIKA_HE_INTERACTION=qgs3`
- low-energy interaction model: e.g., `SIMTOOLS_CORSIKA_LE_INTERACTION=urqmd`

For images generated before this change, it is enough to set one single variable:

`SIMTOOLS_SIMTEL_PATH=/workdir/sim_telarray/sim_telarray`
