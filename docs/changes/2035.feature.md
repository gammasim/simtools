Improve testing of simulation output files (CORSIKA, sim_telarray, light source simulations).
Test now after the simulation the data, log, and metadata output for expected content.
Allows to simplify integration tests, as most tests are already done when running the application.
Add new keyword `skip_integration_test` to allow to skip temporarily certain tests.
