Fixed array trigger file generation to properly combine non-hardstereo telescopes. Previously, each telescope type generated separate trigger lines, preventing software stereo triggers between different telescope types (e.g., SST+MST). Now hardstereo lines remain separate while non-hardstereo telescopes are combined into a single line, enabling cross-telescope-type triggering. Also refactored the implementation into smaller, more testable helper methods with comprehensive test coverage.
