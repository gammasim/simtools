Refactoring the image building process (CORSIKA/sim_telarray/simtools):

- separate images for CORSIKA and sim_telarray
- simtools image combined both plus adds for the development image the QGSJet tables
- main directory changed to `/workdir/simulation_software/` with e.g.
   - `/workdir/simulation_software/corsika`
   - `/workdir/simulation_software/sim_telarray`
- simulation software packages pulled from git repositories
   - CORSIKA7 from KIT gitlab and CORSIKA build configuration from CTAO gitlab
   - sim_telarray, hessio, and stdtools from CTAO gitlab
- new build process for CORSIKA7 using coconut and configuration files
