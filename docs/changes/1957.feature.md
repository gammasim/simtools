Improved version and build info handling:

- simtools application prints at startup now the simtools, database, CORSIKA, and sim_telarray versions
- simtools applications output full build information for log level `DEBUG`
- added two new command line options:
  - `--build_info` to print detailed build information of the application
  - `--export_build_info EXPORT_BUILD_INFO` export build information to file (json or yaml format)
- removed applications `simtools-print-version` (above functionality replaces it)
- Changed path to `sim_telarray` to `SIMTOOLS_SIM_TELARRAY_PATH` (from `SIMTOOLS_SIMTEL_PATH`). This is consistent with the naming of the simulation software packages and the schema values.
