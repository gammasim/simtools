Number of telescope arrays simulated: 1
Array centers are at random offsets within  0.00 m radius from core.
 Impact position correction for bending of primary particle track in geomagnetic field is on.
Up to 100000 bunches are kept in memory before writing to temporary files.
When more than 5000000 bunches are collected per telescope, thinning sets in.
All photon data is enclosed in one block per array.


CORSIKA was compiled with the VOLUMEDET option and the IACT option
automatically adapts to that. This means that all random shower core
offsets are counted in a plane perpendicular to the shower axis.
For non-vertical showers, the horizontal offsets can therefore be
larger than specified in your CORSIKA inputs.

CORSIKA was compiled without the SLANT option and all longitudinal
distributions are in vertical depth units (the classical way).

You are using the IACT option (without CEFFIC) with a bunch size of 1.000000.
You should be aware that this is inefficient with realistic detectors.
A bunch size of the order of 5 would usually be an adequate number for
imaging Cherenkov telescopes instrumented with ordinary photomultiplier tubes.

Cherenkov light vertical distribution is an
emission profile and will not be differentiated.
