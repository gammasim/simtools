# This file describes a test case for changes to model parameters
# All changes to both production tables and model parameters are listed here.
#
# Note! Changes are applied relative to the base model. This file therefore should
# include changes applied for all previous patch updates (if applicable).
#
# Important: do not edit production tables or model parameters directly, but
# only via changes in this file
